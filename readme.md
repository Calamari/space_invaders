# Space Invaders

This is a remake of the famous arcade game Space Invaders. I basically developed that at the evenings of fronteers 2011 conference. It isn't perfect, and there are a lot things that could be improved, but it is fun.

It also includes a Highscore using [github.com/Calamari/highscore](https://github.com/Calamari/highscore) and [Node.js](http://nodejs.org).

## Play it

Play it directly on [jaz-lounge.com](http://jaz-lounge.com).

## Some Things that could be done

* Sounds
* Background Music
* Make it mobile playable

## SpinOffs

There is also a fork done on some LinkedIn Hackathon that adds deezer Background Music, some lazer sound and an additional Boss enemy that is the co-founder of LinkedIn. [Check it out here](http://alexdeleon.github.io/professional_invaders/).
